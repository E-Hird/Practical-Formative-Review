    <h1>Tech firms use remote monitoring to help bees</h1>

    <h2>Why bees?</h2>
    <p>Bees are an essential part of the ecosystem. Without them, it wouldn't be long before our ecosystem collapsed</p>
    <p>
        This is because bees pollinate our wild trees and flowers, which other insects rely on. These insects need to survive to support birds, bats,
        mammals and every subsequent creature in the food chain!
    </p>

    <h2>Why are bees in danger?</h2>
    <p>
        <b>Noah Wilson-Rich</b>, chief scientific officer of US firm <em>The Best Bees Company</em>, says that it's worrying
        how many American honey bee colonies die every year.
    </p>
    <p>
        A <a href="">survey</a> showed that between April 2019 and 2020, 43.7% of US hives were lost. This is a shocking
        figure, and it <i>"just shows how messed up things are currently"</i>, says Mr Wilson-Rich.
