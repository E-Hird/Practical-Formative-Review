  <title>ALS Patient Speaks Again</title>

  <h2>Patient with locked-in syndrome is able to communicate again thanks to brain-computer interface.</h2>

  <p>For the first time, a patient completely paralysed due to the neurodegenerative disease amytrophic lateral
  sclerosis (ALS) was able to communicate verbally through use of a brain-computer interface.
  </p>
  <p>The 37-year old man was able to form words and phrases, despite not having any voluntary muscle control including
  that of his vocal cords. A device with microelectrodes was implanted into the patient's brain and computer software
  was used to translate brain signals.
  </p>
  <p>Other devices have existed previously which are controlled by eye movement or any still functioning facial
  muscles, such as Steven Hawking who used a device that allowed him to communicate by moving his cheek muscle.
  However, when use of these muscles is no longer feasible previously there would have been no way for the
  patient to communicate with those around them. Thankfully, advances in computer science have meant that a
  brain-computer interface could be established, allowing for the patient to match the frequency of his brain
  waves to a certain tone, word, or phrase. This allowed the patientt o achieve either a positive or negative
  result from the system.
  </p>
  <p>Historically, communication from those in a fully locked-in state has not been possible, and so those behind
  this project were unsure if the system would actually work for the patient or not. However, months later the
  patient is able to community with their family effortlessly - something which, without computer science,
  would have been unimaginable.
